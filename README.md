# Part 1
> Complete & submit this part **at least** one week before the assignment deadline.

### Assignment Tasks & the person responsible

Im responsible for everything





### Sketches for the website and short description

# Part 2
> This is where you should describe how the Gestalt principles apply to your site

### Gestalt principles write-up (point form)
> Include images here to make your points easier to understand (and you will have to write less too!)

Proximity:

-Navigation links are grouped together in the header; therefore, one would immediately tell that they are one menu.
-Player's information or that of a particular match is grouped together in sections for readability.

Similarity:

-Color-red, black, yellow, and white-is used throughout the pages for branding to create harmony.
-Buttons, links, and images are also similarly designed in order to create a harmonious interface, which makes the site more predictable and, therefore, easier to use.

Figure-Ground:

-The content is highly contrasted with the background by means of dark and light colors. For example, the bright red header and footer is in good contrast to a light background; white and black text provides good readability.

Continuation:

-The design of the pages is very consistent, having a header, main content area, and a footer. This helps in encouraging the user to keep scrolling down the page since they know where the information is consistently. 
-The navigation bar flows throughout all pages, guiding a user through the site with ease from one section to another.

Closure:

-The use of a logo at the top left and repeating visual elements would complete it, so to say, for the site. It enables users to identify sections and visually close the loop, knowing that each page is part of something greater and cohesive: a website.

Symmetry and Order:

-It gives balance to the arrangement of layout: headers, content, and footers are symmetric. The navigation menu and the rest of the UI elements are equidistant to give it visual appeal, which makes it more appealing and easy on the eyes when navigating through the website.

Common Fate:

-Buttons and other interactive elements  have been built using the same color scheme and styled similarly using hover for feedback. This is so the user will know which elements he can act on.


Document the category of issues that you identified through the manual and automated analysis above
- We didn’t find any issues during manual or automated checks, but the analysis focused on things like making sure the content is clear, easy to use, and works well on all devices.

What kinds of changes did you have to make (I do not want a list here). Generalize the types of issues that you created when building your website, and then the general type of changes that you made to resolve those issues.
- Honestly, no changes were needed since everything was good. But if there were issues, they’d probably involve fixing the layout, making stuff more readable, or improving navigation.

How do these accessibility changes connect with the Gestalt principles we discussed earlier this semester?
- The site already followed Gestalt principles like grouping similar stuff together (proximity), keeping things consistent (similarity), and making sure it’s easy to read and follow (figure-ground and continuity). So, everything just worked well.
